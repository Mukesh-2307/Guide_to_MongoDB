### Non-Relational DB 

### Relational DB => data is stored in the form of tables

- rows => Tuples
- columns => Attributes

> [!NOTE]
> By using DB we can deal with data redundancy and etc.

- EX : If I want to book a train to Goa and search on the IRCTC website, and if IRCTC didnâ€™t maintain a database, the website would display information for all trains. Finding the relevant trains would then become a tedious process. This highlights the importance of having a database.
